This is a machine learning project where one uses the system to scan and identify all the colors used there
<h1>What is Colour Detection?</h1>
Colour detection is the technique of detecting the name of any coloration. Simple isnâ€™t it? Well, for humans this is a really clean venture however for computers, it isn't always straightforward. Human eyes and brains paintings collectively to translate mild into shade. Light receptors which can be found in our eyes transmit the signal to the mind. Our brain then acknowledges the colour. When you consider that adolescence, we've mapped certain lighting fixtures with their shade names. We are able to be using the relatively equal method to stumble on shade names.
