# color-detection-using-machine-learning
This is a machine learning project where one uses the system to scan and identify all the colors used there
<h1>What is Colour Detection?</h1>
Colour detection is the technique of detecting the name of any coloration. Simple isnâ€™t it? Well, for humans this is a really clean venture however for computers, it isn't always straightforward. Human eyes and brains paintings collectively to translate mild into shade. Light receptors which can be found in our eyes transmit the signal to the mind. Our brain then acknowledges the colour. When you consider that adolescence, we've mapped certain lighting fixtures with their shade names. We are able to be using the relatively equal method to stumble on shade names.
About the Python Project
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
